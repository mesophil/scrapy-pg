LINDOKUHLE SOBEKWA Magnum Photos / Born in South Africa in 1995, Lindokuhle Sobekwa came to photography in 2012 through his participation in the Of Soul and Joy Project, an educational program run in Thokoza. His early projects dealt with poverty and unemployment in the townships, while in later work Sobekwa is increasingly addressing his own life, such as his relationship with his sister, Ziyanda, who died after becoming estranged from her family. Most recently, he was announced as the recipient of the first John Kobal Fellowship, presented at Tate Modern in March 2023. Sobekwa became a Magnum nominee in 2018 and a member in 2022. I learn so much from the people I photograph. Working with people in Aw-barre Camp, Hope, Dreams, and Resilience became a central conversation I wanted my work to represent. I wanted to play with metaphors of the rainbow that symbolize hope and promise of a better time to come, as well as a powerful quote from one of the people I worked with.

CRISTINA DE MIDDEL Magnum Photos’ President / Cristina de Middel investigates photography’s ambiguous relationship to truth. Blending documentary and conceptual photographic practices, she plays with reconstructions and archetypes in order to build a more layered understanding of the subjects she approaches. Working from the premise that mass media is reducing our real understanding of the world we live in, De Middel responds to an urgency to re-imagine tired aesthetic tropes and insert opinion in place of facts. De Middel was born in Spain and is based between Mexico and Brazil. She became a Magnum nominee in 2017 and Magnum President in 2022. It is well known that creativity sits in our capacity to subvert the given order of things and the meanings we learned in our journey to adulthood. In my work, I reconnect to the absolute power that we are born with and use while we are still children. It's the same power that turns a folded piece of paper into a boat or a pencil into a rocket and I believe that looking at the world as a place you can change and modify is an essential skill to remind the next generation if we want to make a change. Working with these children in Vietnam gave me plenty of hope for what was to come and it was also a lot of fun.","Machine wash cold, Do not dry clean, Tumble dry low.",https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/size/476354_size.html

His work appeared in well-known fashion magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but he stepped away from the front line in the 1980s. His photo collection Early Color was released in 2006, when he was 82 years old, and was a major hit as he rose to prominence as a pioneer of color photography. Retrospectives and publications featuring Saul Leiter continue to be presented around the world, and a documentary film was released in 2013. Saul Leiter passed away in 2013. Saul Leiter had a knack for capturing peaceful moments that hush the considerable noise of New York City. “It’s been decided that I have a penchant for quietness,” he once said with a chuckle. Whether Leiter is observing a gentle kiss in Times Square amid the hubbub of New Year’s Eve celebrations or finding a solitary young girl in a red coat making a snowball behind a downtown apartment building, the photographer communes with his surroundings to portray a uniquely tranquil vision of his beloved New York.","Machine wash cold, Do not dry clean, Tumble dry low.",https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/size/475763_size.html

Pablo Picasso Painter, sculptor, and printmaker born in Málaga, Spain. In 1900 at age nineteen, Picasso made his first visit to Paris, where he was based from 1904 through the 1940s. In this city of art and culture, he made the acquaintances of Henri Matisse and Georges Braque, who vastly influenced his creative practice. Paris is also where he spent his formative “Blue Period” and “Rose Period” and became known as a founder of the Cubist movement which fundamentally revamped the way that objects are perceived. Historic feats like Les Demoiselles d’Avignon and Guernica combine creative spirit and political messaging into a form that is quint-essentially Picasso. His endless search for new modes of expression led him beyond the world of painting into the realms of sculpture, ceramics, literature and music, leaving a deep impression across the whole of modern art.
