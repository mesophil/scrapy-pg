His work appeared in well-known fashion magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but he stepped away from the front line in the 1980s. His photo collection Early Color was released in 2006, when he was 82 years old, and was a major hit as he rose to prominence as a pioneer of color photography. Retrospectives and publications featuring Saul Leiter continue to be presented around the world, and a documentary film was released in 2013. Saul Leiter passed away in 2013. Saul Leiter had a knack for capturing peaceful moments that hush the considerable noise of New York City. “It’s been decided that I have a penchant for quietness,” he once said with a chuckle. Whether Leiter is observing a gentle kiss in Times Square amid the hubbub of New Year’s Eve celebrations or finding a solitary young girl in a red coat making a snowball behind a downtown apartment building, the photographer communes with his surroundings to portray a uniquely tranquil vision of his beloved New York.","Machine wash cold, Do not dry clean, Tumble dry low.",https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/size/475763_size.html

From the UT collection that has been on sale for about 20 years, popular patterns by Andy Warhol, Basquiat, and Keith Haring will be re-released. Andy Warhol As the preeminent American artist of the 20th Century, Andy Warhol challenged the world to see art differently. This product is produced under a license from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation which promotes the visual arts. Keith Haring A key figure in New York’s East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring’s artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city’s subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,”with abstract marks and patterning. Jean-Michel Basquiat An icon of New York in the 1980s, Jean-Michel Basquiat became renowned during his short career for works inspired by his early street art and a distinctive iconography often connected to art history. His paintings, drawings, and prints drew on a diverse range of sources, from African, Aztec, and Greek cultures to Americana in the form of jazz, baseball, and social and political events. ©/®/™ The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. © Keith Haring Foundation.
